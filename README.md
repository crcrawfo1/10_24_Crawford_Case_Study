## Overview and Origin

* Varo Money was founded in **2015** by **Colin Walsh** who now serves as the CEO, and **Kolya Klymenko** who was also the VP of Technology at Lending Club and more recently a Co-Founder and CTO at Wisetack.

* Varo was founded in order to provide people full access to all of the amenities of a traditional bank solely from their smartphone. In providing consumers with such easy access, Varo is able to avoid all of the traditional costs associated with having brick and mortar branches, allowing them to provide services with much lower, or non-existent fees. This easy access also allows consumers to have instant, and more accessible financial guidance.

* As of June 3rd 2020, Varo has raised **$419.4 million** in funding.  This has come from 6 funding rounds. Most recently Varo has received $241 million in Series D funding. They have 12 investors, some of the most notable being Paul Hewson (Bono of U2), and Progressive Insurance.


## Business Activities:

* Varo is trying to provide people with instant, fee-free access to all of the financial services a bank offers.

* Varo's intended customers are Millenials who have grown to distrust big banks, and who have grown to rely heavily upon the free services that apps are able to offer in order to make their everyday lives easier. As of 2019 Millenials have overtaken Baby Boomers as America's largest generation, meaning that startups, and big businesses alike will need to start more aggressively shifting the focus of their services to a more tech savvy generation. Many startups have realized this, and have been racing to obtain a National Bank Charter (NBC) in order to secure FDIC insurance, a hallmark necessary to operate as an official National Bank within the United States. Fortunately for Varo, they are the first fintech startup to obtain an NBC, putting them ahead of the digital competition. This allows them to be the first official online-only institution able to eventually offer a full slew of services offered by most traditional banks.

* A few of the technologies that Varo currently implements:
    * **Data Lake**, proprietarily **Varolake**, which provides a central data source for internal and external applications. This helps to prevent inconsistencies and redundancies that often occur when utilising multiple sources of data.
    * **Prometheus**, an open source toolkit which can be used in systems monitoring and alerting. This helps Varo when it comes to site reliability engineering. As a company looking to develop an app that functions as a bank, the app running reliably is of the utmost importance.  This is a toolkit that you would see a site reliability engineer using.
    * **Grafana**, which, as a visualization and analytics software, integrates with Prometheus in order to visualize the data that Prometheus helps to provide. 

## Landscape:

* Varo is in the online banking domain of the fintech industry, and over the last 5-10 years, online banking has changed drastically.  From major banks incorporating apps that allow you to access your financial institution of choice from your mobile phone to companies racing to become 'online first' banks that have limited to no brick and mortar branches. 10 years ago mobile check deposits had to be done through a scanner, now you can take a quick picture with your phone and have your check deposited in minutes. Online banking has become so robust, my primary bank only operates out of a state I haven't lived in for over 5 years. Looking forward, we can hope to see banks that operate remotely exclusively, in order to provide people with the most flexibility, and quickest access to their finances possible.

* In terms of competition, it is incredibly rare to find a National Bank without some form of online banking available, so here's a non-exclusive list of other startups trying to break into online-first banking:
    * Chime
    * Current
    * Space
    * Cleo
    * N26


## Results

* Varo has increased the number of users from nearly **1 million** in October of 2019 to nearly **2 million** users in June 2020. This nearly 100% increase in user base can be attributed to their success in obtaining an NBC, and the obvious interest in online-first banking. By offering an annual percentage yield (APY) of 0.81% for base users, and 2.8% for users that meet specific requirements, Varo is beating the national average APY of 0.09% by 800% - 3000%. By accompanying these comparatively massive interest rates for savings accounts with their zero fee policy, and instant access banking, they're offering consumers benefits that traditional banks simply can't match.

* Some of the Key Performance Indicators of the online banking industry include:
    * The number of active clients
    * Applications Launch and Load Time
    * Application Functionality
    * Retention Rate
    * New Lead Generation

As indicated above, Varo's growth over the course of the last year has been massive, and shows no sign of slowing. Regarding App functionality, the app is presently sitting at a 4.8 star rating on the Apple App store and a 4.6 star rating on the Google Play store, indicating immense customer satisfaction with the app.  I was unable to find hard data regarding their retention rate, however the 'New Lead Generation' is obviously going well when considering the growth they've seen over the course of the last year.

* Varo is fairing very well when compared to its competitors. Chime is presently sitting with a higher user-base of 8 million, however their FDIC insurance is dependent upon partner banks as they do not have an independent National Bank Charter, thereby limiting their adaptation of future services. Additionally, it took Chime 4 years to hit 1 million users, whereas it only took Varo 2 years after launching publicly to hit that mark. Current, another competitor, had 500,000 users in October of 2019, with hopes to hit 1 million by mid 2020. However, they also rely on partnerships with parent banks, therefore potentially limiting their adaptability moving forward.

## Recommendations

* As of now, Varo's offerings are relatively limited in that they only offer checkings and savings accounts. I have two suggestions that might improve their popularity. The first being that they should offer automatic investment management for those interested in utilising the stock market. In a similar light, I believe they should offer direct access to the stock market ala RobinHood.

* I think that direct access to the stock market in the same place you do your banking is an obvious benefit in that you don't have to trust third party companies with your financial information. The same place you trust to hold your money would be the same place you confirm trades. A major draw for millenials when approaching apps like Varo is moving away from big banks and other financial institutions that have lost your trust. This is an especially pertinent draw right now due to the fact that RobinHood is under investigation for selling user trading data to high frequency traders.  In terms of automatic investment management, I think the ease of choosing concepts that you believe in, and having robo advisors present ETFs that match your ideals would be highly attractive to those consumers that have limited knowledge of how the stock market works.

* Technologies involved in my recommendations:
    * Robo advisors would allow for people to have their investments managed for them, allowing them to have their money automatically grow at rates (hopefully) higher than their APY.
    * An open source web server allowing Varo to process the high volume of transactions resulting from allowing direct access to the stock market
    * Machine Learning Algorithm in order to determine which customers would most likely be interested in investing, thereby focusing resources for internal advertisement on customers most likely to engage with the new investment features.
