# Varo Money; the bank of the future?


---


## Overview and Origin

* Varo Money

* Varo Money was founded in **2015**.

* Varo was founded by **Colin Walsh** who now serves as the CEO, and **Kolya Klymenko** who was also the VP of Technology at Lending Club and more recently a Co-Founder and CTO at Wisetack.

* Varo was founded in order to provide people full access to all of the amenities of a traditional bank solely from their smart phone. In providing consumers with such easy access, Varo is able to avoid all of the traditional costs associated with having brick and mortar branches, allowing them to provide services with much lower, or non-existant fees. This easy access also allows consumers to have instant, and more accessible financial guidance.

* As of June 3rd 2020, Varo has raised **$419.4 million** in funding.  This has come from 6 funding rounds. Most recently Varo has received $241 million in Series D funding. They have 12 investors, some of the most notable being Paul Hewson (Bono of U2), and Progressive Insurance.


## Business Activities:

* Varo is trying to provide people with instant, fee-free access to all of the financial services a bank offers.

* Varo's intended customers are Millenials who have grown to distrust big banks, and who have grown to rely heavily upon the free services that apps are able to offer in order to make their every day lives easier. As of 2019 Millenials have overtaken Baby Boomers as America's largest generation, meaning that startups, and big businesses alike will need to start more agressively shifting the focus of their services to a more tech savvy generation. Many startups have realized this, and have been racing to obtain a National Bank Charter (NBC) in order to secure FDIC insurance, a hallmark necessary to operate as an official bank within the United States. Fortunately for Varo, they are the first startup to obtain an NBC, putting them ahead of the digital competition. This allows them to be the first official online-only institution able to offer a full slew of services offered by most traditional banks.

* A few of the technologies that Varo currently implements:
    * Data Lake, proprietarily Varolake, which provides a central data source for internal and external applications. This helps to prevent inconsistencies and redundencies that often occur when utilising multiple sources of data.
    * Prometheus, an open source toolkit which can be used in systems monitoring and alerting. This helps Varo when it comes to site reliability engineering. As a company looking to develop an app that functions as a bank, the app running reliably is of the utmost importance.  This is a toolkit that you would see an site reliability engineer using.
    * Grafana, which, as a visualization and analytics software, integrates with Prometheus in order to visualize the data that Prometheus helps to provide. 

## Landscape:

* Varo is in the online banking domain of the fintech industry.

* Over the last 5-10 years, online banking has changed drastically.  From major banks incorporating apps that allow you to access your financial institution of choice from your mobile phone to companies racing to become 'online first' banks that have limited to no brick and mortar branches. 10 years ago mobile check deposits had to be done through a scanner, now you can take a quick picture with your phone and have your check deposit in minutes. Online banking has become so robust, my primary bank only operates out of a state I haven't lived in for over 5 years. Looking forward, we can hope to see banks that operate remotely exclusively, in order to provide people with the most flexibility, and quickest access to their finances possible.

* In terms of competition, it is incredibly rare to find a National Bank without some form of online banking available, so here's a non-exclusive list of other startups trying to break into online-only banking:
    * Chime
    * Current
    * Space
    * Cleo
    * N26
